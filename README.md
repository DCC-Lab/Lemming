# LEM: Lemming Enumeration Module

## CAD files
CAD models are made using Fusion360 and the files are saved on the Autodesk360 cloud. Ask Mireille to get the access (you need an Autodesk360 account).

## Python code and simulations
Code is written using Google Colaboratory, and is accessible via the group Google Drive (dcclab.crulrg@gmail.com, you know the password).
